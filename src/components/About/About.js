        I am a Web Developer with a background in manufacturing with ability to build 
        a sophisticated website with full database backend all the way from mockup 
        to rollout. I work well with teams of diversely talented people and I am 
        also a fast learner who is always ready and willing to learn something new.
            I have worked in manufacturing for over 7 years and it has afforded me 
        a mindset of production and of quality-oriented products. I have successfully
        applied my past work expirience to my current studies as a web developer. In 
        production I have worked in teams to meet deadlines and have also helped in 
        production scheduling.
